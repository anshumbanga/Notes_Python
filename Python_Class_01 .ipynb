    "Sure, here are the key features of Python listed in bullet points:\n",
    "- **Interpreted Language:** Python executes code line by line, allowing for immediate feedback and rapid development.\n",
    "- **Case Sensitivity:** Python is case-sensitive, meaning variables and identifiers must be typed consistently throughout the code.\n",
    "- **High-Level Language:** Python abstracts low-level details, providing a simpler and more intuitive syntax for developers.\n",
    "- **Simplicity and Readability**: Python's syntax is straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Interpreted and Interactive**: Code is executed line by line, facilitating rapid development and experimentation.\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented**: Supports OOP principles, allowing the creation of reusable code through classes and objects.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming**: Supports functional programming paradigms like lambda functions and list comprehensions.\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Standard Library**: Includes a vast collection of modules and libraries for various tasks.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform**: Code can run on multiple platforms without modification.\n",
    "- **Community and Ecosystem**: Large and active community contributing libraries, frameworks, and tools.\n",
    "- **Embeddable and Extensible**: Can be embedded within other applications and extended with modules in languages like C and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a versatile programming language used across various domains and industries. **Some of the prominent areas where Python finds application include:**\n",
